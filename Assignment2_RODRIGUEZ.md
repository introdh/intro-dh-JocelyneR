  I conducted my topic modeling project using the American Journal of Political Science. I chose this journal being that
political science is a field that changes along with society, shifting its topics of interest along with public concerns of 
the moment and current events. Furthermore, political science places a great value in cumulative enterprise, being the usage 
of prior research to build upon in order to create new knowledge, which gives us another reason to study past reseach 
findings. In order to investigate changes in discourse and research topics of interest in recent years, I restricted my corpus 
to research articles published within a 20 year period from 1992 to 2012, which consisted on a total of 1215 documents. I 
chose to find a total of 25 topics being that it is a large enough number of topics to be able to find some trends within the 
topics found and draw conclusions about the corpus, yet it is also small enough that it is easy to produce a comprehensible 
visual model that does not show too much overlap and avoids unnecessary repetition.

  The results of topi modeling for the American Jouranl of Political Science showed the main topics of concern between 1992 
 and 2012 have not changed too much since they remain a current topic of interest today. Although there were 25 different 
 topics, they all seemed to fall into one of these categories: decision making and bill passing, elections and turnout,
 foreign and public policy, and media coverage and public opinion. During the recent past presidential elections foreign and 
 public policy were two of the main issues being debated by the candidates. Also, after the results discourse regarding
 election and turnout theories became a central topic of discussion as well as public opinion and bill passing as we discussed
 new legislative changes supported by the new president and the public's reaction. Nonetheless, these topics of interest are 
 not unique to a short post-electoral period. The results of this topic model show that these the previously mentioned topics
 have been a constant subject of interest between 1992 and 2012 as well, which mean they are not unique to today's political 
 scene. 

  Further possibilities for research on the American Journal of Political Science using topic modeling would be to investigate
  topics in the journal using a bigger corpus covering a greater time period. I wonder if using a corpus that covered a biger 
  time period would change the overall trends in the results. It would also be interesting to investigate how the topics 
  change when producing different numbers of topics. Some limitations to topic modeling also come along these lines. When 
  using topic modeling there are many assumptions we make in order to decide how we want to produce topics such as the number
  of topics as well as the choice of corpus. Furthermore, the interpretation of the set of topic produced is somewhat 
  subjective making the results of topic modeling hard to use as an only form of evidence.
