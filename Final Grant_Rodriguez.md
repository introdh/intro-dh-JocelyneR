## Abstract 

Gender inequality in political representation presents a problematic aspect of our current political system. Current political 
theories recommend seemingly contradictory approaches in the design of female political campaigns. It is recommended for women 
to run while presenting themselves as more feminine in order to keep feminist votes and meet traditional voter gender 
expectations. At the same time, it is also recommended for women to run while presenting themselves as less feminine in order 
to distance themselves from gender stereotypes that could hurt their campaign. Using, speeches from campaigns of women running 
for state-level political offices, we will conduct text analysis to investigate style and content of these campaign speeches. 
Style will be investigated through Voyant while content will be investigated through topic modeling using Mallet and R. The 
results of text analysis will be used to create an interactive map to reflect the results through states and time. The 
expected results of this project is to better understand gender expectations for women running for political office in order 
to develop a more comprehensive model of campaign strategies for female candidates. 

## Narrative

# Enhancing the humanities

Running in Heels is a Level I project that will work with topic modeling and mapping to investigate the style and content of 
speeches during political campaigns of women running for state-level political offices. This is a project to create a more 
comprehensive model of political behavior regarding campaign strategies for women running for office across time and different 
areas of the United States. This project was inspired by recent statistics published by the Center for American Women and 
Politics which found that only 23% of government offices in 2016 were held by women regardless of having a majority female 
American population.  Furthermore, the US is currently ranked 104th in women’s representation in government in the world. 
These statistics showed the United States are falling behind in gender equality in political representation. 
	Gender inequality in political representation presents a problematic aspect of our current political system that 
brings up the question of possible solutions. When questioning different approaches to increase the number of female political 
representatives, one finds theoretical puzzle. Current political theories recommend seemingly contradictory approaches in the 
design of female political campaigns. There are two famous theories in political behavior for women running for office. The 
first theory recommends that women should appear more feminine when running for office. This theory is based on the belief 
that women who play to their gender and appear more feminine during campaigns tend to be more popular among feminist voters 
(Dolan, 1998) at the same time they meet voter expectation by behaving the way most voters would expect them to behave 
according to traditional social expectations. The second theory recommends women should try to appear less feminine when 
running for office (e.g. Banwart 2010; Huddy and Terkildsen 1993). This second theory is based on an approach to try to avoid 
disadvantages that result from a candidates gender. It has been found that gender affects political campaigns and that women 
face a number of disadvantages when running for office due to gender stereotypes that portray women as less competent 
politicians (e.g. Hayes 2005; Lawless, 2004; Huddy and Capelos 2002; Fridkin 1994). In other words, gender stereotypes often 
hurt political campaigns of women and trying to appear less feminine when running for office is seen as a way for women to 
distance themselves from these gender stereotypes and avoid the disadvantages that result from gender when running for office. 
To summarize, women running face the expectation of appearing more feminine at the same time they appear less feminine during 
their campaigns. This paradox is something worth investigating further for it mirrors a greater cultural problem that involves 
the contradictory gender expectation many women face not only in politics but in other aspects of daily life including their 
careers.  Furthermore, it is important to try to solve this puzzle as a way of advancing a solution to the current lack of 
female representation in politics. 
	This research project seeks to answer a number of humanities questions. First, we would like to start by questioning 
how gender affects running for political office. Then we would like to investigate what are the expectations for women running 
for office (are women expected to portray themselves as more or less feminine?, what topics are they expected to address?, and 
is there a specific style of speech or a way of speaking about issues that is most ‘acceptable’ for women?). This question is 
inspired by the puzzle stated above and is meant to help us understand the different theories in practice and see how they 
reflect in real life campaigns. Another question we seek to investigate is how do expectations vary through history and 
geography. Political science inquiry seeks to use research findings  to make theories as generalizable as possible but 
sometimes generalizing too much can be problematic. A reality of our country is that not all states or areas are at the same 
place in the journey for gender equality. The United States is such a big country that different geographical states are more 
ahead or behind in gender equality. For this reason conducting research across geographical lines can lead to a better 
understanding of gender expectations in politics. Furthermore, studying these gender expectations through history as well, can 
provide useful information to understand the way in which gender equality has change through time and maybe anticipate future 
change in gender representation based on past trends. Finally, we can use the answers to these questions to answer a further 
question regarding the best approach when designing a political campaign for a woman running for political office.
	We anticipate that this research project on political behavior will help further humanities inquiry in different ways. 
First we anticipate that it will help understand challenges in gender representation in politics. We also plan to further 
inquiry by providing a different evaluational standard to analyze gender bias in today’s culture. Moreover, we seek to provide 
information according to time and space to address the issue of political representation and gender expectations through 
history and geography. Lastly, one of the most important ways in which we hope to further inquiry through this project is by 
testing the extent of women’s voice in politics and the power of women in influencing policy-making that affects them. 
	The scope of investigation of this research project the inquiry into political behavior by gender. More specifically, 
this project will conduct topic modeling of campaign speeches of female candidates running for political state-level offices 
from 1992 to the present. The results of this topic modeling will be used to create an interactive map to show states in which 
women benefit from different gender frameworks during campaigns.The temporal scope of the corpus to be investigated is due to 
historic political events occurring in 1992. We will begin looking at speeches for campaigns after 1992 being that this was 
known historically known as the year of the woman. This year marks a new era in American politics after an unprecedented 
number of women were elected into political office during this year, changing the way we view women in politics and the 
dynamics of political theory regarding gender. 
	We expect the outcomes of this project to be of intellectual value to scholars, students, and general audiences. We 
expect to provide students and scholars with a clearer picture of challenges female candidates face as well as a more 
comprehensive model for campaign strategies for women. Furthermore, for a general audience we expect to provide information 
that will lead to a better understanding of female representation in government and the voice of women in policymaking, as 
well as information regarding gender expectations is today’s American culture. 	

# Environmental scan

Many projects have been done regarding female representation in politics, and many more are currently in progress following 
the past elections. Yet, three of the main projects investigating gender representation in politics that I found most 
interesting are: The Distorted Mirror (Fridkin- Arizona State), Running against a Woman (Dolan- University of Wisconsin), and 
What Is the Difference Between a Hockey Mom and a Pit Bull? (Burns, Ebenhardt, Merolla). The Disorted Mirror is a research 
project that investigates gender bias in media towards political candidates for state level offices. This project conducts 
content analysis of newspaper articles and political campaign websites to investigate how media distorts the perception of 
candidates according to gender. The Distorted Mirror provides a description of how media affects the way women are perceived 
with relation to gender expectations and biases. Running against a Woman is a project that investigates how women running for 
office affect the political campaigns of men running against them. This project is important because brings into attention 
another way in which more women running for office could influence political discourse even when they are not elected. Lastly, 
The Difference Between a Hockey Mom and a Pit Bull is one of the most similar projects to Running in Heels as well as one of 
the main inspirations. This project investigates the perception of Sarah Palin (while she was running as vice president) 
through an experiment that had participants read different stories in which she was described either under a female or male 
framework. Running in Heels investigates a similar issue while using different methods and sample sizes. We borrow from the 
use of content analysis used in Distorted Mirror, while taking a different approach through topic modeling and including 
mapping. At the same time we investigate a similar issue to that in The Difference between a Hockey Mom and a Pit Bull, 
replacing social experiments with content analysis and increasing the size in sample in order to obtain greater statistical 
significance. 
	After reviewing similar projects being done or previously published, we found that many of them use experiments and
survey analysis, which results in subjective  results. By using different methods of digital humanities, we hope to make 
results more objective and be able to use technology to enhance the way results are presented through topic models and 
interactive maps. Furthermore, many of the past projects have struggled with sample size due to the lack of female 
representation. In order to address this issue we have moved down to state-level offices and expanded the temporal scope to 
include candidates within a period of 25 years. This trade-off should allow us to increase the number of candidates included 
in the investigation as well as the statistical significance of findings. Lastly, this project not only looks at results as 
representative of the country as a whole but breaks down results to analyze them in context of individual states. 


# History of the project 

Preliminary research has been done to identify the scope of data available as well as statistics to anticipate the size of 
samples and corpuses to be used. Equipment and academic support necessary for the project are already available and we count 
with the support of research advisors in political science and digital humanities. 
	As a Level I grant, this research project will continue after the period of the grant. Similarly, the journey to 
equality in political representation is a work in progress and so we plan to continue advancing this project through time to 
include future political campaigns. We plan to accomplish dissemination and the continuation of this project with the help of 
the Institute for Women’s Policy Research IWPR, a leading think tank in the United States that applies quantitative and 
qualitative analysis of public policy through a gendered lens. This think thank works to conduct and communicate research to 
inspire public dialogue, shape policy and improve representation of women of diverse background and circumstances, and offers 
internships and fellowships for students interested in research on women’s representation in policy.


# Work plan

The tasks to be accomplished during the grant period include collecting the transcripts of speeches during political 
campaigns. Once the corpus has been collected text analysis will be conducted. Text analysis will have two components. First, 
style will be examined using Voyant to find word frequencies, distinctive words, and most common words used in the speeches. 
Second, content will also be studied through content analysis using Mallet and R to create a topic model to display topics 
covered in these campaign speeches. During text analysis controls will be used by comparing Democrat vs Republican candidates, 
women who won elections vs women who lost elections, and female vs male candidates. Comparisons will be also drawn between 
different years and states. Then,  using the results from text analysis,  we will an create interactive map to show states in 
which women benefit from different gender frameworks during campaigns. Mapping will be accomplished by using ArcGIS. Research 
is expected to be conducted during a period of 6 months. The first two months will be used to collect the documents used for 
the corpus, the third and fourth month will be used to conduct content analysis and obtain the necessary statistics and 
information to be used for mapping. The creation of the interactive map will occur during the fifth and sixth month. Project 
results should be ready for final review and dissemination by the end of the sixth month. 
	Staff members involved are University of Richmond professors Lauren Tilton and Ernest McGowen. Professor Tilton will 
provide guidance in the field of digital humanities, while professor McGowen will provide guidance in the field of political 
behavior theory. Progress of the project will be reviews monthly by both advisors and a final review will be done by an 
Nicolas Martinez, an advisor from IWPR, before dissemination. Collaboration  with IWPR will be important for both final review 
and dissemination and well as post-grant continuing research.
	The major possible risk that could affect the overall schedule is not being able to find transcripts of older speeches 
of interest. For this reason, prior preliminary research has been done to find helpful databases to find the speeches 
necessary. We have also schedule enough time for this phase of the project to account for possible challenges in collecting 
this data. Furthermore, monthly reviews are schedule for guidance with any possible challenges that could arise during the 
research period.

# Dissemination

The main medium of dissemination will be a website for the project which will include all the result along with a detailed 
explanation of methods and background, the topic model, and an interactive map to present results. A summary of the research 
project and its findings will also be published through the IWPR website with a link to the main project website. 
The project website will be reviewed by students and faculty of the University of Richmond to ensure information in the 
website is clear and understandable by an outside audience.  
All findings by this project will be published available for open access.
